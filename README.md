# Password-Generator

    I was given starter code for a password-generator with no functionalty. I needed to execute creating a code that would work after clicking on the "generate password" button. After that, create terms and limitations based on what the user requested in their password. For example, numbers, lower case letters, upper case letters, and special characters included or excluded based on the user's requests. 

Applications used:
